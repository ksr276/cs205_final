# TODO: Modify this file to create a shell script that is able to use awk to go through a file formatted like pokemon.dat and provides a printed report in the following format (where your script correctly calculates the values that go into the [VALUE] placeholders):
# ===== SUMMARY OF DATA FILE =====
#    File name: [VALUE]
#    Total Pokemon: [VALUE]
#    Avg. HP: [VALUE]
#    Avg. Attack: [VALUE]
# ===== END SUMMARY =====

# The "Avg." values should be calculated as mean values for the corresponding columns.
# The spacing and header formatting should match the above formatting description exactly.
# There should be a comment explaining the purpose of each line in your shell script. 
# The data file will be passed in to the script as a positional parameter and will not necessarily be called pokemon.dat. However, you can assume that any file passed to this script will be formatted exactly the way pokemon.dat is formatted.

#!/bin/bash

FILE="$1"
#here, our file is our first variable, in this case being pokemon.dat
TOTAL=$(awk 'END {print NR-1}' $FILE)
#NR-1 ensures that the first row is not counted when displaying the total amount of pokemon
HP=$(awk 'BEGIN{FS "\t"}NR-1{sum+=$6}END{print sum/(NR-1)}' $FILE)
#Here, the field separator is identified as tab. the total of column 6 is added then divided by the total number of inputs
ATTACK=$(awk 'BEGIN{FS "\t"}NR-1{sum+=$7}END{print sum/(NR-1)}' $FILE)
#this is the same as the other average, with the 6th column being replaced by the 7th

echo "===== SUMMARY OF DATA FILE ====="
echo "	File name: $FILE"
echo "	Total Pokemon: ${total}"
echo "	Avg. HP: ${HP}"
echo "	Avg. Attack: ${ATTACK}"
